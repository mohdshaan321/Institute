            <h1>Sri Guru Sai Institution is one of the Best Home Tuition and Group Coaching providing institution in
                Bangalore​</h1>
            <p>Looking for Best “Home Tuition ‘and’ Group Coaching” in Bangalore? Sri Guru Sai Institution is a well
                known name amongst the student population in and around JP Nagar. Located at a very convenient location
                , ‘So We have been successfully conducting Home Tuition ,Group Coaching Classes for various boards . We
                also offer Distance Education help, and Navodaya Entrance examination Coaching . We have a dedicated
                flock of experienced teachers roped in to coach our students.</p>
            <p>Sri Guru Sai Institution has helped many students to improve their examination score in the past. Thus,
                we have gained a good reputation among the parents and students in JP Nagar area. SGS Institution is
                also known for providing excellent support after assigning tutors. We strive hard to maintain
                transparency by providing routine performance report to the parents on their wards work.</p>
            <p>As our lives becomes faster and faster, we have gadgets and people to support our busy lives.From helpers
                to support us in daily chores to appliances to reduce our efforts in cooking, we have someone or
                something to support us. Then, why shouldn’t we take the help of quality tutors to support and
                supplement our kids in their studies? This very thought has led to the development of Sri Guru Sai
                Institution or SGS Institution. Here we take your ward’s studies very seriously.We study your

        <h1>LEADERSHIP</h1>
        <h2>Sai Rakesh</h2>
        <h3>Founder / Chairman</h3>
        <p>I firmly believe, that the potential of a student could be best brought out, if they do not waste time in
            mundane activities of shuttling to and fro in the highly polluted roads with traffic jams at every corner of
            the road. With that in mind,I formulated the concept of Home Tuition in Bangalore known as Sri Guru Sai
            Institution. Wherein tutors would go to the house of the students and teach them. Individual attention,less
            time in commuting, Transparency are all the best bets in a home tuition. At the same time for those living
            in and around JP Nagar, Jayanagar areas, our institution provides Group Coaching, where Learning is made Fun
            with group activities, Mock Tests etc, . The concept of working in Teams-which is very important as the
            students grow up in life, is ensured and encouraged. Overall, Sri Guru Sai institution provides a wholesome
            package, of Home Tuitions in Bangalore, Group Coaching, Computer Learning, Navodaya Examination Coaching and
            Distance Education support, from which the students can select the one that suits them the best. We hand
            pick quality teachers, give them good orientation before assigning them to the students. For me, Quantity
            does not matter, what is important is the quality. Even if it is a handful students, I want to provide the
            best service to them. Finally, a success of any organization depends on its Goodwill. I believe, Happy
            Customers lead to Successful Organization.</p>
